WRITE FILES IN PYTHON
In order to write to a file, we first open it in write or append mode after which, we use
the pythonâ€™s f.write() method to write to the file!



# Open the file in write mode
f = open("this.txt", "w")
# Write a string to the file
f.write("this is nice")
# Close the file
f.close()
