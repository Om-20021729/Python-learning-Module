# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?
s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}
#  sets themselves are mutable—you can add or remove elements—the elements contained within a set must be immutable and hashable. Therefore,
#   you cannot include a list within a set, nor can you change the values inside a list contained in a set.
