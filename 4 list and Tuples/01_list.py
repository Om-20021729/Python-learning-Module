#LIST METHODS.

# Consider the following list:
#l1 = [1,8,7,2,21,15]
# l1.sort() updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
# print(l1)
# l1.reverse() : updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
# print(l1)
# l1.append(8) adds 8 at the end of the list 
# print(l1)
# l1.insert(3,8) This will add 8 at 3 index
# print(l1)
# l1.pop(2) Will delete element at index 2 and return its value.
# print(l1)
# l1.remove(21) Will remove 21 from the list. 
# print(l1)
